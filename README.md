### Hi there

- I currently work as a backend developer at a web services company.
- I learned to program on an APPLE ][+ (an early Apple computer) in 1986 and studied computer science at university.
- I have mostly used C/C++, PHP, and occasionally Python.
- Nowadays, I'm interested in the Go programming language.
- Learning Rust is one of my goals for this year.
