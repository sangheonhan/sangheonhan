### Hi there

- I currently work as a backend developer at a web services company.
- I learned to program on an APPLE ][+ (an early Apple computer) in 1986 and studied computer science at university.
- I primarily use Python, Go, and PHP, and occasionally use Perl and C/C++.
- I am currently studying Rust and making efforts to use it in my work.
- As a minimalist, I want to apply minimalism to my work and coding.
